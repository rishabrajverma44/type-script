State-Driven Modular JS Architecture with Vite
## Objective

You will build your **entire UI and application logic using plain JavaScript**, but in a **React-style architecture** — where UI is rendered based on **global state**, updated only through **events**, and **modularized into components**.

You’ll use **Vite** for modern module-based development and simulate concepts like:

- Component-based UI
- Unidirectional data flow
- Global reactive state
- Reusable utilities
- Structured folder-based architecture
